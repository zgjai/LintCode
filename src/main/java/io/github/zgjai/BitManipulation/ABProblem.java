/**
 * Write a function that add two numbers A and B.
 *
 * There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function aplusb, you job is to
 * calculate the sum and return it.
 *
 * Clarification
 * Are a and b both 32-bit integers?
 * Yes.
 *
 * Can I use bit operation?
 * Sure you can.
 *
 * Example
 * Given a=1 and b=2
 * return 3.
 *
 * Challenge
 * Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not do it like that?(You should
 * not use + or any arithmetic operators.)
