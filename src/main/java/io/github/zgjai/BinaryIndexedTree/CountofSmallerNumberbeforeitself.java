/**
 * Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array,
 * data value from 0 to 10000) .
 * For each element Ai in the array, count the number of element
 * before this element Ai is smaller than it and return count number array.
 *
 * Example
 * For array [1,2,7,8,5], return [0,1,2,3,2]
 *
 * Clarification
 * Before you do this, you'd better complete the following three questions：
 * Segment Tree Build， Segment Tree Query II，and Count of Smaller Number before itself I 。
 *
 * Notice
 * We suggest you finish problem Segment Tree Build,
 * Segment Tree Query II and Count of Smaller Number first.
