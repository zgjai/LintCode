/**
 * Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array,
 * value from 0 to 10000) and an query list. For each query, give you an integer,
 * return the number of element in the array that are smaller than the given integer.
 *
 * Example
 * For array [1,2,7,8,5], and queries [1,8,5], return [0,4,2]
 *
 * Challenge
 * Could you use three ways to do it.
 *
 * Just loop
 * Sort and binary search
 * Build Segment Tree and Search.
