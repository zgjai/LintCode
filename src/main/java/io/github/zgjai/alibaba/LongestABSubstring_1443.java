 * Please output the length of this substring.
 * This substring can be empty.

 * Example
 * Given s = "ABAAABBBA", return 8.
 * Explanation: Substring s[0,7] and s[1,8] meet the conditions, their length is 8.
 *
 * Given s = "AAAAAA", return 0.
 * Explanation: No substring satisfies the condition except empty substring.
