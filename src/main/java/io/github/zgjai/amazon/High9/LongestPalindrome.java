 * Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can

 * Example
 * Given s = "abccccdd" return 7
 *
 * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
 *
 * Notice
 * Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1010.
